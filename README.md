## Calendrio
# Summary
Discord bot that reminds the user of any upcoming events using an input of a .ics file, .iCalendar file, or calendar download URL.

# Inspiration
I would often get too caught up in school and would end up neglecting to check my calendar to remind myself of due dates, and since I use Discord on an almost daily basis, I figured that I would be able to integrate the two in a meaningful way.

# Technical Dependencies
The bot runs on a Python backend that is hosted on Repl.it and UpTimeRobot to stay operational 24/7. 
It uses the requests, icalendar, and discord Python modules.


# How to run it locally
Install the required libraries by typing the following commands in your Windows Command Prompt.
```
pip install requests
pip install discord.py
pip install python-dotenv
pip install icalendar
```
